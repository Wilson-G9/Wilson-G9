# .gitattributes — tune GitHub Linguist language stats
# Place this file at the repository root. Adjust paths below to match your repo layout.

# Exclude common notebook formats (treat as vendored/documentation so Linguist ignores them)
*.ipynb linguist-vendored
*.ipynb linguist-documentation

# Exclude directories that often contain generated or vendor code
notebooks/** linguist-vendored
data/** linguist-vendored
vendor/** linguist-vendored
third_party/** linguist-vendored
external/** linguist-vendored

# Mark generated code so Linguist ignores it
generated/** linguist-generated
build/** linguist-generated
dist/** linguist-generated
*.min.js linguist-generated

# Docs and examples (if they are mostly prose)
docs/** linguist-documentation
examples/** linguist-documentation

# If you have large Python vendor libs or protobuf/auto-generated Python files,
# point them here so they won't inflate the Python percentage.
# e.g. sensors/third_party_lib/** linguist-vendored

# Force a specific file or folder to be treated as a different language
# (uncomment and edit paths as needed)
# path/to/some_script.py linguist-language=Text
# web/frontend/dist/** linguist-language=JavaScript

# Notes:
# - After you commit & push this file, GitHub will re-calculate language stats (may take a few minutes).
# - Use linguist-vendored for vendored dependencies and large generated sources.
# - Use linguist-generated for machine-generated code you want ignored.
# - Use linguist-documentation for notebooks, markdown-heavy docs, or example data.
# - Do NOT use these attributes to hide important application source code from reviewers.
